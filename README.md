Certification project 3 of 5 for [FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design).\
I made it about [Nmap](https://nmap.org/) because that was a fun tool to use in the Ethical Hacking course that I took.\
Project completed on 2025-01-01.

## Features
* Responsive layout for desktop and mobile screen sizes
* Flexbox
* Accessibility-focused styling for smooth or non-smooth scrolling preference
* Harmonious visuals (theme-appropriate shapes and color scheme)
* Some of my own extras added for additional spice (scroll-back-to-top button for mobile screen sizes, aesthetically pleasing section separators)
* Non-breaking spaces in a few places where it makes sense
